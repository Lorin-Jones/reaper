Reaper is built in React using Javascript with a JSON library API. I have recently introduced Material UI for styled components, and will be updating features as time permits.

Current plans for ongoing development of Reaper:

1. Build updated backend using either Python/Flask or Ruby/Rails. This will depend on whether I decide to update quickly in order to demonstrate facility in my current stack and deepen knowledge, or if I choose to convert gradually as I learn Ruby/Rails.
2. As I implement a more robust backend, I plan to containerize using DOCKER, and automate with MAKE.
3. On frontend, I plan to clean up and optimize the current code, improve overall design, and add features like a star rating system.
